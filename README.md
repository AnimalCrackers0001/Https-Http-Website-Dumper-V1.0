Excellent Website dumper I made it takes a while to dump because it has a web URL crawler in it too

Instructions:

Input a website url and then click dump then it will dump all the files from the website includes:
            file_types = [
                '.exe', '.rar', '.jar', '.zip',
                '.mp4', '.mov', '.mp3', '.wav',
                '.png', '.gif', '.jpg', '.jpeg',
            ]

Then click on Check and it checks if all the file addresses are valid!

Then you can create a cyber capture by selecting a directory first and then create a cyber capture by clicking on Cyber Capture!

Then you can download the dumped files from the website and it will download them automatically in the same latest cyber capture you've created.

Note: That it takes a while to download the files because it's basically downloading a file from your browser instead it's downloading all the files from the website so make sure to not close the software right away
